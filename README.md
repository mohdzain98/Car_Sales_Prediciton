# Car Sales Prediciton<br>
Machine Learning is used across many ranges around the world.
Sales prediction is the current numero trend in which all the business 
companies thrive and it also aids the organization or concern in determining 
the future goals for it and its plan and procedure to achieve it.
In this project, the application of supervised machine learning techniques are 
used to predict the sales of cars. The predictions are based on historical data 
collected from Kaggle, an online verified repository. Different techniques like 
Linear regression, Adaboost Regression, random forest, KNN Regression,
Support Vector Machines and decision trees have been used to make the 
predictions. I then evaluated and compared the predictions so that we are able 
to find the algorithms and techniques which provide the best performances. All
methods provided comparable performance.<br>
As a result we can say Linear Regression predicted with more accuracy then other models followed by Random Forest and Adaboost Regression.<br>

The Neural Network model was implemented on the same dataset with same training and testing data and it was seen that accuracy(r2_score) was approx same for both models,this may be due to the small size of CSP dataset for neural network.
